# OctoPrint-Uninterruptible

Monitor the state of an attached uninterruptible power supply and control print jobs accordingly.

This plugin adds a UPS status indicator to the navbar. When clicked, a dropdown with more information is displayed (i.e. textual status, battery state of charge, estimated battery time remaining).

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/zblassman/OctoPrint-Uninterruptible/archive/master.zip

This plugin requires [Network UPS Tools (NUT)](https://networkupstools.org/) to first be installed and a single UPS configured locally (at least for the time being).

## Configuration

**TODO:** Describe your plugin's configuration options (if any).
